Description:
The lab has been split up into three parts: sketch_part1, sketch_part2, and sketch_part3. In part 1, we implemented a simple addition function using assembly. In part 2, we implemented add, subtract and testasm. In part 3 we implemented the Fibonacci sequence function.

See comments on explanations for each of these functions.
